I feel so perplexed. I want to be a girl, I wanted that as long as I can remember. It just feels so right and I hate every aspect of being a guy. But idk if I'm willing to lose everything just to approach this goal. I can never truly be a girl and be comfotable with myself, so why risk it? What if it just worsens my depression because I'll lose my friends and family. And the political situation?? I'll probably be persecuted for wanting to express my true self.
But what if it really is the cure? What if it gives me the push I need to finally better myself? What if it's the thing that can keep me alive? Why am I the one who needs to decide? I'm so scared of the decision, but if I ever decide now's the best time. I want it so badly, but probably can't do it. 

Pomoc
